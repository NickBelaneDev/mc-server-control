### **Do you run your Minecraft Server on a Proxmox LXC Container?**

#### Then this might be interesting to you!

The project's target is to create a ServerController-Module that lets you direct your server
from outwards. I am planning to include a simple telegram bot to start, stop the server and to
perform basic operations as well as monitoring the stats.

The project is in its rare beginning and is mainly ment to be a cool starter project for
my linux home lab journey.
