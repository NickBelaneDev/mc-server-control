### **Do you run your Minecraft Server on a Proxmox LXC Container?**

#### Then this might be interesting to you!

The project's target is to create a MCServerController-module that lets you direct your server
from outwards. I am planning to include a simple telegram bot to start, stop the server and to
perform basic operations as well as to monitor the server-stats.

The project is in its rare beginning and is mainly meant to be a cool starter project for
my linux home lab journey.
